# trading-point-prediction-model

This is the final project for my bachelor degree.We can regard the price of a stock as a one-dimensional nonlinear time series signal,and there are many models in the field of artificial intelligence that have excellent performance in predicting nonlinear time-series signals. In this project, we combine different neural network models, artificial intelligence is trained to predict the buying and selling points of stocks by giving inputs such as opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price and average price.
